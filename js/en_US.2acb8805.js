The company later claimed that the schedule was only practiced managing extra workflow during peak season - September and October, and that the schedule was not compulsory.</p>\n<p>In early 2019, <strong><em>Youzan</em></strong> (<code>有赞</code>, a Hangzhou-based E-commerce company) announced the company would adopt &quot;996&quot; work schedule in the annual convention. Bai Ya, the CEO of Youzan, responded: &quot;This will definitely be a right decision when we look back in a few years.&quot;</p>\n<p>In mid-March 2019, it was reported that <strong><em>JD.com</em></strong> (<code>京东</code>, a major E-commerce company) started adopting &quot;996&quot; or &quot;995&quot; work schedules in some departments. The PR posted that (Our culture is) to devote ourselves wholeheartedly (to achieve the business objectives) via Maimai (<code>脉脉</code>, a Chinese real-name business social network platform).</p>\n<p>Gaining more publicity only recently, this work schedule, however, has long been a known &quot;secret&quot; practiced in a lot of companies in China.</p>\n<h2>Compensation and benefits</h2>\n<p>According to the Labour Law, employees who follow the &quot;996&quot; work schedule deserve to be paid 2.275 times of their base salary. Unfortunately, people who work under &quot;996&quot; rarely receive overtime pay.</p>\n<h2>Where does the name of the repo <code>996.ICU</code> come from?</h2>\n<p>If you continue to tolerate the &quot;996&quot; work schedule, you will risk your own health and might need to stay in an <em><strong>I</strong>ntensive <strong>C</strong>are <strong>U</strong>nit</em> someday.
